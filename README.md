# Hey, I'm Sarai! 👋

I really enjoy coding and mainly I do it in React JS now. Before, I was in touch with some mobile language as Swift or Java for Android, even a little bit of Kotlin. Also, I code some APIs so I was near Java code aswell.

Nowadays, I work at [Liferay](http://liferay.com/) as a Software Engineer making a great Open Source product.

- I was born in the amazing city of [Salamanca](https://goo.gl/maps/pR7Doopm4V8m7qWH7) ❤️
- I love animals, specially cats 🐈
- I love tabletop games. [Mansions of Madness](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/205059/mansions-madness-second-edition) is one of my favourites 🎲
- In my free time I play tennis, go for a run or just walk for hours 🎾
- I really enjoy watching TV shows and movies 📺
- I like all kind of music 🎵
